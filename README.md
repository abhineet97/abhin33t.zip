A website for me. Generated by [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](http://pages.cloudflare.com).

# Development Setup

Download and install the [expected version](/.nvmrc) of Node.js using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then run:

```sh
nvm use
npm install
```

Now, you can:

- `npm run serve` to start an auto-reloading development serve.
- `npm run build` to build the site into `_site`.

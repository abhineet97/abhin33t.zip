A website for me. Generated by [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/abhineet97/abhineet97.github.io.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/abhineet97/abhineet97.github.io)

# Development Setup

Download and install the [expected version](/.nvmrc) of Node.js using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then run:

```sh
nvm use
npm install
```

Now, you can:

- `npm run serve` to start an auto-reloading development serve.
- `npm run build` to build the site into `_site`.
